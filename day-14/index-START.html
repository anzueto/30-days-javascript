      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // team is just a reference to the original array


      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      const team2 = players.slice();

      team2[3] = lux;

      // //////////------------ jose note: here we made a copy of team, but we are only updating that copy not the original

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // //////////------------ jose note: this will also make a copy of the array
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // //////////------------ jose note: here we made a reference, not a copy
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
      console.log(cap2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

        name = 'wes',
        age = 100;

          facebook: 'wes.developer'
        }
      }

      // lets make a copy of the wes object


      //this works but doesnt go levels deep
      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);


      // here we we passed an object on JSON stringyfy and return that as a string
      // then you parse it and that turns it back into an object
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
